TIM (TIM Improves Merging) is a semantic merge conflict detection tool meant to aid in the parallel development process. TIM automatically compares new changes to the main branch with your feature branch and notifies you if your change has a semantic conflict. It utilizes symbolic execution to generate an exhaustive list of test cases and is able to identify these silent semantic merge conflicts.

## How to Run and Test TIM
When pushing to a repository with TIM enabled within its CI pipeline, creating a pull request (PR) will automatically run TIM on the changes within that pull request. This is how tests can be run to detect semantic merge conflicts within different code changes.
